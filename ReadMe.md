Predictive Analytics




The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the
assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a
Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.




PART - 1

PART - 2
Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning
● Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic
Regression, Decision tree, KNN
● Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the
above-mentioned algorithm.
● Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5
classifiers (including the ensemble).
