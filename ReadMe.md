CSE 487/587 Assignment 1:Predictive Analytics
The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the
assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a
Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.
PART - 1
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms
● Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest
● Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
● Implement K-Means Clustering
● Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of
squares
The implementation should only use NumPy and Pandas as external libraries. The
implementation should be within the definition of the functions in the predictive_analytics.py file.
Any utility function should be defined within its scope.
Evaluation - Total of 55 Points
● Function implementing K-NearestNeighbour algorithm ( 5 Points )
● Function implementing Random Forest (25 Points)
● Function implementing PCA (5 Points)
● Function implementing K-Means Clustering (12 Points)
● Function for Accuracy (2 points)
● Function for Recall (2 points)
● Function for Precision (2 points)
● Function for Within Cluster sum of squares (2 points)
The points are for the correct implementation. This is validated by getting comparable accuracy
on the test set with the standard library like Scikit-learn. Make sure that the code is optimized
and does not take a long time to run.
PART - 2
Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning
● Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic
Regression, Decision tree, KNN
● Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the
above-mentioned algorithm.
● Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5
classifiers (including the ensemble).
Evaluation:- Total of 45 Points
● Implementation of supervised algorithms SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
KNN, using Scikit-learn and report accuracy (10 Points)
● Creating an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the above-mentioned
algorithms and report accuracy (10 Points)
● Creating visualizations using Matplotlib library for the confusion matrix of each model
(use subplot) (10 Points)
● Perform Grid search on hyperparameters of SVM, Decision Tree and KNN and create
plots using Matplotlib (15 Points)
Dataset:-
You are provided with data.csv along with this document. The data has 48 features and the last
column corresponds to the label. Use this to implement your algorithms. Your algorithms will be
evaluated on a private test set, and points will be allocated on the basis of the performance on
this test set.
